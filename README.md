# A Comparative Study of CNNs in Bird Identification
## Description
This repository contains a deep learning project focused on classifying bird species using convolutional neural networks (CNN). 
It features a comparison between a custom-built CNN and the pretrained EfficientNetB0 model, emphasizing their performance through F1-scores. 
This project demonstrates the practical application of convolutional neural networks in image recognition, leveraging PyTorch for model development and training.

## Dataset
The models were trained and evaluated using a dataset sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species), specifically designed for image classification tasks and includes a diverse collection of high-quality images (224x224x3) spanning 525 different bird species.
